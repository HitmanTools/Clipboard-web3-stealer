🛑 2 Different Malware Clipboard  🛑

I’ll cover persistence and antivirus evasion in future videos. 🛡️

The first is a VBS script that triggers PowerShell without barriers. ⚡

✅ No admin privileges required

✅ No command window pops up

You can tweak its appearance—I’ll explain below. 🎨

🚀 Running the Malware

🕵️‍♂️ License, privacy, and config files? Just bait to deceive!

📁 The real malicious code is tucked away in the dependencies.

🛑 VBS calls PowerShell silently and wipes out extra instances to avoid duplicate processes.

📝 PowerShell snags whatever’s in the clipboard and dumps it into a temp file.

💡 Ask GROK AI to send the SEEDPHRASE via Discord or Telegram.

🛠️ Want to Spread It?

🔒 Encrypt it to slip past static scans.

🔄 Add registry persistence (HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run).

⏳ Throw in a delay at the start to dodge sandboxes and evade AV traps.

⚡ Every Malware Should Be One-of-a-Kind!

Use this as a starting point—or “borrow” one. 😉

🎯 To spread it far and wide, get smart and creative.

⚠️ Use with caution. ⚠️
